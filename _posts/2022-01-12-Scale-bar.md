Scale bars are essential features of a figure in a publication. Matplotlib doesn't have this implemented but there is an add-on module that allows you to draw scale bars in your figures. 

The module is only available using pip and you can install it with

```bash
pip install matplotlib-scalebar
```

To insert the scale bar in your figure you have to create a scalebar patch which will be inserted in the figure:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib_scalebar.scalebar import ScaleBar

img = np.random.normal(0,1,size=(100,100))

plt.imshow(img)

pixel_size = 60/1590
scalebar = ScaleBar(pixel_size, 'mm') # 1 pixel = 0.2 meter
plt.gca.add_artist(scalebar)
```
