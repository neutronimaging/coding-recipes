Scale bars are essential features of a figure in a publication. Matplotlib doesn't have this implemented but there is an add-on module that allows you to draw scale bars in your figures. 

The module is only available using pip and you can install it with

```bash
pip install matplotlib-scalebar
```

To insert the scale bar in your figure you have to create a scalebar patch which will be inserted in the figure:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib_scalebar.scalebar import ScaleBar

img = np.random.normal(0,1,size=(100,100))

plt.imshow(img)

pixel_size = 60/1590
scalebar = ScaleBar(pixel_size, 'mm') 
plt.gca().add_artist(scalebar)
```

If you use ```plt.subplots``` the same effect can be achived with
```python
fig,ax = plt.subplots(1,2)
ax[0].imshow(img)

pixel_size = 60/1590
scalebar = ScaleBar(pixel_size, 'mm')
ax[0].add_artist(scalebar)

```
